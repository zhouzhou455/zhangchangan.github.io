## Honors and Awards
1. Awarded two first prizes in the Excellent Highway Design Awards in China.  

   Mr. Zhang led the design of nearly 30 km of dual-bore eight-lane tunnels and proposed a super-large-span tunnel design concept, which focuses on reducing surrounding rock damage. He invented an excavation method for super-large-span hard rock tunnels, filling gaps in the standards, significantly reducing construction costs, and improving construction efficiency.
   
   This method has been widely applied in major projects, including the southeast extension of the Jinan Southeast Second Ring Road, the reconstruction of the Lianhuo Expressway Xiaowu section, and the expansion of the Shimentangshan Tunnel on the South China Expressway in Guangzhou.

2. Awarded the First Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress by the China Highway Construction Industry Association.

   He participated in the "Key Technologies of Constrained Concrete Support for Large Cross-Section Tunnels in Complex Geological Conditions" project, proposing a constrained concrete support system for large cross-section tunnels. The research outcomes achieved fast and safe construction for large-span tunnels, winning the First Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress by the China Highway Construction Industry Association.
